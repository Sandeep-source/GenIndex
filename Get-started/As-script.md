2. Navigate to GenIndex directory.
  
   ```shell
   cd GenIndex
   ```
 
3. Run python script by path to directory (repo or site) for which we are generating pages.

  ```shell
  ./GenIndex  path_to_repo_or_site
  ```

4. Check the directory and open ðŸ”§ index.html. You will may face some difficulty navigating between pages if you observing pages on local machine.
   After deployment to github pages these issues will be fixed.
6. Yeah! ðŸ¥³, We just generated.

```
Note: If you already have a index.html file your dir them you don't see any changes because by default GenIndex didn't override existing file to
avoid acidental deletion of you siteðŸ˜¬
```
